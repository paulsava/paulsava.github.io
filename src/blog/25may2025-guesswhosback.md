# guesswhosback.mp3

Yup, it's me again! You probably weren't expecting this grand comeback after I so easily abandoned my resolution to write at least one blog post per month. Classic me.

In my defense, I set myself up for failure: in February I went to Berlin for my first Berlinale (incredible experience, by the way), and naturally I planned to write about it. But when I sat down to actually write, I realized I had *so much* to say about all the films I'd seen. What started as a simple blog post idea snowballed into this overwhelming project where I felt I needed to cover dozens of films. And well, for a chronic procrastinator like me, that was basically a death sentence for the whole endeavor.

## What I've been doing since then

Not much, but there are some things that I am proud of:

- I finally launched my little balcony garden project! I'm now growing two tomato plants, basil, mangold, two types of lettuce, and loads of flowers. No photos yet because there's construction chaos around my building—some neighbor is renovating, and I've got this massive scaffolding situation. The funny part? I got an official notice saying the scaffolding would block my balcony, so I frantically moved all my hanging plants... only to discover the scaffolding is actually two balconies over. Thanks for nothing, building management.

- I've started diving into research for my PhD, finally carving out time despite being swamped with work projects. I've managed to nail down some key ideas and begun the implementation phase. Right now I'm working on getting LLMs to output self-confidence scores—basically having them rate how certain they are about their own answers. Then I'm digging into the model's internals to see what's actually driving those responses. Are specific attention heads lighting up? Is it something in the residual streams? Still figuring it out, but I'll definitely share if I uncover anything interesting.

- Discovered what might be the best coffee beans of my life at [Kohi](https://www.instagram.com/kohi.freiburg?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==) in Freiburg—one of the few places I've seen using a Modbar system. They rotate guest roasters, and I got to try these incredible [naturally processed anaerobic beans from Ethiopia](https://friedhats.com/products/ethiopia-buku-sayisa-anaerobic?Roast=Espresso&Size=250gr), roasted by Friedhats in Amsterdam. They reminded me of the Superfreak beans from [Wide Awake](https://wideawake.coffee/) in Brussels. Interestingly, both work way better in milk drinks than straight espresso.

- Picked up two books I've been meaning to read: *The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity* by David Graeber and David Wengrow, and *Invisible Women: Exposing Data Bias in a World Designed for Men* by Caroline Criado Perez. I'd already skimmed the first one after watching [Moise's excellent video](https://youtu.be/e9UeKOz5QRE?feature=shared) about it, and the second is genuinely essential reading for everyone. I had both on my Kindle, but I'm slowly accepting the harsh truth: if a book isn't physically visible somewhere—on my desk, shelf, coffee table—I'll probably never actually read it.



## What to expect next

Actually, nothing. It's better to assume I won't write anything new until next year and be pleasantly surprised when I do, than to expect the monthly blog post that will inevitably disappoint you. I am trying, I promise, but... we'll see.
