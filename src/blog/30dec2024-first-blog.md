title: My plan for 2025

description: So I am a blogger now, huh?

I've been putting this off. Master thesis and general life stuff got in the way. But now it's time to start.

I want to share interesting things I work on. That's it. This feels like the right place to do it.

The site has three parts:
- Publications: My academic work, free to access
- Projects: DIY stuff like 3D printing espresso parts and building an aeroponic garden
- Blog: Thoughts on tech, movies, music, food, and whatever else

One of my resolutions for 2025: Post something every month, even if it's brief.

Let's see how this goes.
