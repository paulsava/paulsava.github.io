            <p>Hey there! I'm Paul, and you've just stumbled upon my little corner of the internet.</p>
            <p>This site isn't trying to win any design awards - it's just a simple space where I share my work, thoughts, and the things that keep me busy.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="what-i-do">
            <h2>What I Do</h2>
            <p>Right now, I'm diving deep into AI research at <a href="https://www.aisec.fraunhofer.de/">Fraunhofer AISEC</a> while working on my PhD at <a href="https://www.tum.de/">TUM</a> with <a href="https://www.sec.in.tum.de/i20/people/claudia-eckert">Prof. Dr. Claudia Eckert</a>. I spend most of my time thinking about:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>→ Making large language models more secure (and figuring out when they're not)</li>
                <li>→ Teaching AI agents to be autonomous (but not too autonomous)</li>
                <li>→ Keeping machine learning private (because some secrets are worth keeping)</li>
                <li>→ Finding ways to break AI systems (so we can make them stronger)</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>My Background</h2>
            <p>I did both my Bachelor's and Master's at TUM. </p>
        </section>

        <section id="beyond">
            <h2>Beyond the Code</h2>
            <p>When I'm not buried in research papers, you'll find me obsessing over coffee. I mean really obsessing - I can talk about extraction ratios and bean origins until your eyes glaze over. One day, I'd love to open my own espresso bar or roastery.</p>
            <p>I've got some fun projects in the pipeline too. There's this vertical aeroponic garden I'm planning (fresh herbs, here we come!), and I've been eyeing woodworking as a potential hobby. Finding time between research and perfecting my espresso shots is the real challenge though!</p>
            <p>Oh, and I'm always on the hunt for obscure films and new music. Because life's too short for mainstream entertainment, right?</p>
