            <p>Hi, my name is Paul and welcome to my little corner of the internet.</p>
            <p>This is my personal website, and while it might not be the most glamorous thing you've ever seen, it's a reflection of who I am and what I'm passionate about.</p>

        <section id="what-i-do">
            <h2>What I Do</h2>
            <p>I'm currently working as a Research Associate at <a href="https://www.aisec.fraunhofer.de/">Fraunhofer AISEC</a> and a PhD candidate at the <a href="https://www.tum.de/">Technical University of Munich</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://www.sec.in.tum.de/i20/people/claudia-eckert">Prof. Dr. Claudia Eckert</a>. My research mainly focuses on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>→ Large Language Models & Security</li>
                <li>→ Autonomous AI Agents</li>
                <li>→ Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning</li>
                <li>→ Adversarial Machine Learning</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>My Background</h2>
            <p>I completed both my Bachelor's and Master's in Computer Science at the Technical University of Munich (TUM).</p>

        <section id="beyond">
            <h2>Beyond the Code</h2>
            <p>I'm a huge coffee enthusiast - I love exploring different coffee shops and learning about extraction ratios and bean origins. One of my dreams is to eventually open my own espresso bar or roastery. I've also got some exciting plans for the future, including setting up a vertical aeroponic system for growing herbs and salads. Woodworking is another skill I'd love to learn, though finding the time between research and my coffee adventures is proving to be quite the challenge! When I'm not working, you'll probably find me hunting down obscure films or getting lost in music.</p>
