# Welcome to my personal website!

This site was built entirely with the assistance of Claude-3.5. I'll be honest — I never really had the patience to dive into front-end development.

But something a friend said during a hackathon has stuck with me, even though I can't recall if he actually said it or if it came to me in a dream after more than 24 hours of grinding on some quirky project. It went something like this:

## About Me

I did my Bachelor's in Computer Science at TU München, where I wrote my thesis on Physical Adversarial Examples against Object Detectors at Fraunhofer AISEC. This was under the guidance of Prof. Dr. Claudia Eckert, Dr. Jan-Philipp Schulze, and Dr. Philip Sperl. (I’ll probably write a blog post someday about why I decided to study in Germany—link coming soon!)

After that, I stuck around TUM for a Master’s in CS and started working at Fraunhofer AISEC as a HiWi. My Master’s thesis was about using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate network mapping and asset discovery, again with the awesome team at Fraunhofer AISEC.

As of August 1st, 2024, I’m working full-time as a Research Assistant (Wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter) at Fraunhofer AISEC, and I'm planning to pursue a PhD soon.
