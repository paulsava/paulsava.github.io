            I'm currently working as a Research Associate at Fraunhofer AISEC, where I get to dive deep into 
            some fascinating areas where Security meets AI. My research mainly focuses on:

      <h2>My Background</h2>
      <div class="underline"></div>
      <p>
        I completed both my Bachelor's and Master's in Computer Science at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). 
        During my studies, I had the opportunity to collaborate with Fraunhofer AISEC, which really shaped my 
        interest in AI Security and led me to where I am today.

      <h2>Beyond the Code</h2>
      <div class="underline"></div>
      <p>
        I'm a huge coffee enthusiast - I love exploring different coffee shops and learning about extraction ratios 
        and bean origins. One of my dreams is to eventually open my own espresso bar or roastery. I've also got some 
        exciting plans for the future, including setting up a vertical aeroponic system for growing herbs and salads. 
        Woodworking is another skill I'd love to learn, though finding the time between research and my coffee adventures 
        is proving to be quite the challenge! When I'm not working, you'll probably find me hunting down obscure films 
        or getting lost in music.
