            <p>Hey there! I'm Paul, and you've just stumbled upon my little corner of the internet.</p>
            <p>This site isn't trying to win any design awards - it's just a simple space where I share my work, thoughts, and the things that keep me busy.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="what-i-do">
            <h2>What I Do</h2>
            <p>Right now, I'm diving deep into AI research at <a href="https://www.aisec.fraunhofer.de/">Fraunhofer AISEC</a> while working on my PhD at <a href="https://www.tum.de/">TUM</a> with <a href="https://www.sec.in.tum.de/i20/people/claudia-eckert">Prof. Dr. Claudia Eckert</a>. I spend most of my time thinking about:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>→ Making large language models more secure (and figuring out when they're not)</li>
                <li>→ Teaching AI agents to be autonomous (but not too autonomous)</li>
                <li>→ Keeping machine learning private (because some secrets are worth keeping)</li>
                <li>→ Finding ways to break AI systems (so we can make them stronger)</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="background">
            <h2>My Background</h2>
            <p>I spent my university years at TUM, getting both my Bachelor's and Master's there. While my main focus was on ML and AI Security, I also dove into High Performance and Quantum Computing. I started at Fraunhofer AISEC as a student assistant in 2021, and after finishing my Master's in 2024, I joined the team full-time.</p>

        <section id="beyond">
            <h2>Beyond the Code</h2>
            <p>When I'm not doing research, I like to mess around with coffee brewing. It's become a bit of a hobby - trying different beans, tweaking recipes, that kind of thing. Maybe I'll open a small coffee shop someday, who knows.</p>
            <p>Got a few projects I want to get into - building an aeroponic setup, getting into woodworking, and playing around with 3D printing. Also picked up crocheting recently, which is surprisingly chill.</p>
            <p>In my downtime, I dig through obscure movie collections and hunt for underground music. Always fun to find something different that most people haven't heard of.</p>
